## Quiz 1: D-matrix

1. The 9x9 D matrix is a Tensor?

81-component D matrix is a tensor, as it maps one tensorial quantity - strains to another - stresses


2. The 6-component stress and strain vectors are Tensors?

Yes, the stresses and strains are tensorial quantities as they map normal vectors to stresses and strains respectively.

3. The 6x6 component D-matrix can be used for modeling only under the following conditions
(X) Homogenous
(X) Isotropic
(X) Rotation equilibrium is conserved
( ) Anisotropic
( ) Heterogenous


4. What is the Poisson's ratio of an undrained material?

0.5, because undrained means no volume change. 

## Quiz 2: Elastic tests

* For an Oedometer test choose which of the following statements are true

(X) The lateral stresses are zero
( ) The lateral strains are zero
(X) The lateral stresses are a function of K0
( ) There is no volumetric strain
(X) Can be used to measure the Young's modulus of the material

* In a plane strain problem, there is stress in the out-of-plane direction. 

- True
 
* Problems appropriate for plane strain analysis

( ) Pile driving
(X) Excavation supported by a retaining wall
(X) Strip footing
( ) Circular raft foundation
(X) Slope stability analysis
(X) Construction of a tunnel
(X) Geotextile reinforced landfill construction
