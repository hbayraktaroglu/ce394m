In continuum mechanics we saw how to express forces acting on a body as stress tensors which are independent of a frame of reference, and deformation kinematics expressed in terms of strain tensors.


The observations of normalized soil behaviour lead to the Normalise Soil Parameter concept. 
According to NCP, similar trends are bserved when you normalize the undrained strength Su to the normalized
vertical effective stress sigma vo' and the OCR. 

SHANSEP approach considers the effects of stress history and stress path in characterizing soil strength and predicting
the field behaviour. 

Soil stiffness is related to the undrained shear strength Su by adopting a constant ratio of
shear modulus G over Su. The input parameter G/Su allows to model the increase of stiffness
with depth and thereby its variation with the current effective stress state.

Seah & Lai in 2003 found a relationship for soft clays using undrained triaxial compression and extension tests.
They observed that the ratio of G50/Su to be a function of OCR raised to an exponent, which depends on compression or extension test.
